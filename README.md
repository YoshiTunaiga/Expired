# Expired

## Overview

Instead of waiting to have an expired tuna or expired milk, why not track it, so the next time you go shopping, you’ll know what’s almost due. Expired?, don’t let it expire you.

## MVP

- Users can create an account and decide which locations in the house need tracking. From Kitchen dispensers and fridge to bathroom cabinets and emergency kits.
- User does not need to provide more information than the email and password.

## Tech Stack and Libraries:

- TypeScript
- Angular JS
- Firebase
